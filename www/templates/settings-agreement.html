			<p>
				This Agreement or any claim, cause of action or dispute (“claim”) arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Wisconsin regardless of your country of origin or where you access Bankmybiz.com, and notwithstanding of any conflicts of law principles and the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods.
